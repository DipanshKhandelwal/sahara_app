## WHAT IS DECENTRALIZATION ?
Decentralization means the network operates on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis without a central server.

## WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN ?
An incorruptible and a digital ledger in which transactions are recorded chronologically and publicly. This ledger is maintained by a peer-to-peer public network.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The current contribution system of NGO works in a biased manner. There is no record of the transactions available to any individual other than the centralized authority. All transactions of the donated amount is behind closed doors. Since the amount donated is for the good of the public, the lack of transparency in the workings of the NGO is a major issue. Data tampering can easily be done. Therefore, the system becomes corruptible. This lack of transparency and corruption leads to less donations as donors can not trust the NGOs. 

## PROPOSED APPROACH
The proposed solution is a blockchain-based application where the NGOs will function on a decentralized platform where contributors can make contributions to the Funding Requests, they deem legit. The requests made by the project creators will be approved by the contributers. The system works on consensus i.e. a request will be finalized if more than half of the authorised nodes on the system approves the requests. Funding requests can be merged if required.

## SOLUTION
The decentralized platform provided by the NGO will have no transparency as the request approval process will be based on consensus mechanism, due to which data tampering is not possible.Each authorised node will have a record of the transaction of requests, which will be updated time to time. This makes the system incorruptible as the centralized authority does not exists any more.
